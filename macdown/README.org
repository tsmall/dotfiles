#+TITLE: MacDown Config Files

I like to create typographically well-designed,
attractive emails.
While email programs rarely give you good typography options,
I've come up with a solution
using a combination of Markdown,
MacDown,
and a custom CSS file.

* Setup

1. Install [[http://macdown.uranusjr.com/][MacDown]].
2. Create a symbolic link to =Email.css=
   in =~/Library/Application Support/MacDown/styles=.
3. In MacDown > Preferences > Rendering,
   choose "Email" in the CSS drop-down.
