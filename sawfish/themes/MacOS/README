Traditional MacOS theme, based on System 7 screenshots.

Initial draft made with sawfish-themer, and hacked up by hand to
correctly handle varying text widths in the title bar.  Some of the
code for that was borrowed from microGUI and Chromium.

Note especially the fact that you can't resize a window by grabbing
the borders!

MacOS has a lot of different types of windows that all get lumped in
as 'transient' under X (modal dialogs, modeless dialogs, palettes,
etc).  This theme has a pretty conservative approach to transients (in
"transient" and "shaded-transient"), but look at its handling for
"shaped-transient" windows for an alternate approach.  This theme is
not totally accurate, because I don't have access to a Mac for
thorough testing.  I'd love to hear about any improvements.

If anyone has a traditional MacOS gtk theme (pref. engine), I'd love
to hear about that, too.  All the ones I can find are MacOS8 pixmap
themes.
